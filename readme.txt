== Description ==

[Contact Form 7 Charts](http://www.tuckerhall.com/2013/contact-form-7-charts-for-wordpress/) is a plugin for automatically generating dashboard charts from Contact Forms DB and Contact Form 7 forms activity. The plugin is useful for visually tracking the performance of content marketing campaign conversions, surveys, feedback and contact forms, and conducting visitor research on your WordPress website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I remove a contact form from the charts? =

The plugin only collects statistics on forms that have active content within the study period (six months or one month respectively).  Deleting the form will remove it from the chart, or disabling it will remove it after the respective period has passed.
